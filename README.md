# Fit Scale

This project uses a Fitness Calculator API in order to fetch data related to a user's fitness needs. Users can easily navigate between all tabs due to the app using dynamic routing with react-router-dom.

The project focuses on the most popular forms of data every fitness enthusiast is bound to look for during their fitness endeavors.
Based on personal experience, this app is formed to be an easy one stop shop where one can find all the information surrounding their body status which I would have personally loved to have. Imperial and metric units are both offered in order to cater to all people from around the world. 

_Technologies Used: React, HTML, CSS, 3rd Party External APIs_
